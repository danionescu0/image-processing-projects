# Person monitor

[work in prgress]

In this project we're going to implement a real time person monitor with email notification,
text to speech etc.

We're going to receive face notification from "Face recognition wrapper" over MQTT and react
to them by:

- sending email with known/unknown person 

- use a text to speech API to communicate by voice 

- track known persons on a graph using free IOT platforms like thinger.io

- configure known persons, email notification etc etc in a graphical UI
